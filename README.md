# Kotlin JS Wrapper for Firebase

This was just meant to be a module I use for another project. There are awesome multiplatform libraries out there for Firebase already. This just uses some parts of them for my own use and only for JS. The two libraries I used were:

https://github.com/lamba92/firebase-multiplatform (For the JS definitions)
https://github.com/GitLiveApp/firebase-kotlin-sdk (For kotlin serialization but modified to use the latest version)

Thanks to both libraries above and you should check them out.

For now, this only has implementations for Firebase initialization and using Firestore. More will be added as needed!
